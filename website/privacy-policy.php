        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>This privacy policy governs the use of the Clinician Health Tracker application (app) for mobile devices. Clinical Health Tracker App is a tool that clinicians and researchers may use to track certain clinical parameters. Your clinician or researcher may use all or some of the information provided by Clinical Heath Tracker App. Your clinician may be using Clinical Heath Tracker app to follow your progress. If you are using Clinical Health Tracker App as part of a research study, the study protocol will have been approved by a Human Research Ethics Committee. You will have provided written informed consent, to take part in the trial, this will detail the reasons for using the Clinical Health Tracker App and reiterate the information that the app will collect. This document details all the information that the Clinical Heath Tracker App is capable of collecting.</p>
        
        <p>Clinical Heath Tracker App will have no impact on your data usage as it will only send data when you have a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
        
        <p>Clinical Heath Tracker App will never send your personal details, it uses a unique ID (see below) to identify the data it collects from your phone. All data is stored securely and separately from any personal information.</p>

        <h4><u>Information We Collect</u></h4>

        <p><strong>User provided information - General</strong></p>

        <p>To use this application, you are required to have a "unique ID". Your unique ID will be generated upon registering to participate in a clinical trial or to agreeing to be monitored by your clinician. You will use your unique ID when first using the Clinical Health Tracker app.</p>

        <p>When your clinician registers you, they will provide your first name, last name, date of birth, and email address. If you are participating in a research study you may also be required to provide information relevant to the study you are participating in.</p>

        <p>Any information that can be used to identify you is kept securely and separate from the information that is collected by the Clinical Health Tracker App, as any data the Clinical Health Tracker App collects will be associated with your unique ID only.</p>

        <p><strong>User provided information – Clinical Health App Specific</strong></p>

        <p>You may be required to complete multiple questionnaires, these will have been discussed with you prior to registering with the app. The app is capable of recording your responses to four questionnaires, the Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and The World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO DAS) record information about your quality of life, the Life Space Assessment (LSA) records information about how much you get out and about and the Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP) provides information about how active you are.</p> 

        <p>You will also be required to regularly complete a 6-minute walk test. The number of steps you take and the distance you walk during the 6-minute walk test will be recorded.</p>

        <p>Data collected via activities within the application (questionnaires and 6-minute walk test data) will be sent to a secure database, with your unique ID, upon completion of the activity when connected to Wi-Fi. If you are not connected to Wi-Fi, the collected data will be stored within the application, and sent with automatically collected information (see below) when you are next connected to Wi-Fi. If you do not connect to Wi-Fi before this data has been sent to the database and the application is closed, it will be deleted.</p>

        <p><strong>Automatically collected information</strong></p>
        
        <p>The Clinical Health Tracker App will collect various data automatically. These data are limited to your GPS data, which will be recorded every 15 minutes and step counts, and distance walked will be obtained from Apple’s health App. You will receive a weekly prompt to allow the data from Apple’s Health App (step data and distances walked) to be sent to the secure database.</p>

        <p>When you are connected to Wi-Fi the automatically collected data will be sent, along with your unique ID, to a secure database. If you are not connected to Wi-Fi, the collected data will be stored within the application, until you gain a Wi-Fi signal or until it is closed (in which case it will be deleted)</p>

        <h4><u>How we use information collected</u></h4>

        <p>Your step, distance walked and GPS data will be analysed by your clinician, to monitor your progress. The GPS data will never be used to identify where you have been or where you live. It will be used to calculate the area that you live your life in and how much time you spend out of your home.</p>

        <p>We will never provide your personal details to third parties. The information we collect will be used to monitor your progress, used in clinical research and may be published in medical journals, however you will never be identified, this includes not identifying where you have been or where you live.</p>

        <h4><u>If you wish to opt-out</u></h4>

        <p>You have the right to opt out of the data collection process at any point. Opting out of information collection is as simple as uninstalling the application from your device. We would recommend discussing withdrawing from any study with your clinician, so they can clarify what you want to happen with data that has already been collected, you are justified to ask for this to be deleted.</p>

        <h4><u>Data Retention and Security</u></h4>
        
        <p>User provided information and automatically collected information will be transferred for as long as you use the application. The stored databases will be kept for a minimum of 7 years</p>

        <p>Information collected (user provided and automatically collected) will be stored on a secure database. Your personal information (provided upon registration) and the data collected as part of the clinical trial you are participating in (questionnaire data, 6 minute walk test data, automatically collected data) will be stored in separate databases. Trial data will only be associated with you via your "unique ID", which is generated upon registering for a clinical trial and provided by your clinician.</p>

        <h4><u>Changes</u></h4>
        
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time, for any reason and without prior notice. We encourage you to regularly review this privacy policy to ensure you are up to date with it.</p>
